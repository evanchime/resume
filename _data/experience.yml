  summary: 
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>Programmed a TM4C123  Cortex-M micro-controller in C</li>
      <li>
        Implemented an Internet of Thing; extended the power of the microcontroller by adding a Booster
        Pack;  connected to an access point that provided communication with the Internet; used a client-
        server protocol to collect weather information; deployed a client-server system that logged local
        information on a shared server
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented a real-time synchronization by designing a finite state machine controller. Using the
        microcontroller, the  finite state machine simulated a traffic control system in a 4-corner intersection,
        including sensors for cars travelling south and west, and a sensor for pedestrians
      </li>
      <li>Interfaced DC motors with Pulse Width Modulation PWM and also Stepper motors(for a robot car)</li>
      <li>
        Designed a distance meter. A linear slide potentiometer converted distance into resistance (0 ≤ R ≤ 10
        kΩ). Software used a 12-bit Analog to Digital Converter(ADC) built into the microcontroller. The
        ADC was sampled at 40 Hz using SysTick interrupts. Wrote a C function that converted the ADC
        sample into distance, with units of 0.001 cm. The data stream was passed from an Interrupt Service
        Routine(ISR) into the main program using a mailbox, and the main program outputted the data on a
        display connected to a  Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter(UART).
      </li>
      <li>
        Sampling analogue signals using the ADC interface; development of an ADC device driver; used
        ADCs for pressure, temperature, and humidity sensors;  the development of an interrupt-driven
        real-time sampling device driver;  the development of a software system involving multiple files
      </li> 
      <li>
        Implemented time delay functions. Designed software that converts numbers into ASCII strings and
        displays the string on the display connected to UART0.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designed and built a prototype simple pacemaker. The system will read from a switch, make
        decisions, and outputs to an LED. Wrote subroutines that wait for the switch to be pressed, wait for
        the switch to be released, and create an output pulse of fixed duration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Built a switch interface that implements positive logic, and an LED interface that implements
        positive logic.  Attached this switch and LED to a protoboard, and interface them to a TM4C123
        microcontroller
      </li>
      <li>Worked closely with customers to efficiently resolve issues.</li>
      <li>
        Saved 8% on supply costs by working closely with suppliers to ensure that all components met
        company quality standards.
      </li>
    </ul>
