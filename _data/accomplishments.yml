#Accomplishment 1
- summary:
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
        <li>Programmed a TM4C123  Cortex-M micro-controller in C. These are some of the things I was able to accomplish with the micro-controller
          <ul>
            <li>Implemented a real-time synchronization by designing a finite state machine controller. 
              Using the microcontroller, the  finite state machine simulated a traffic control system in a 4-corner intersection, 
              including sensors for cars travelling south and west, and sensor for pedestrians
            </li>
            <li>Implemented an Internet of Thing; extend the power of the microcontroller by adding a Booster Pack;  
              connected to an access point that provided communication with the Internet; 
              used a client-server protocol to collect weather information; 
              deployed a client-server system that logged local information on a shared server
            </li>
            <li>Designed a distance meter. A linear slide potentiometer converted distance into resistance (0 ≤ R ≤ 10 kΩ). 
              Software used a 12-bit Analog to Digital Converter(ADC) built into the microcontroller. 
              The ADC was sampled at 40 Hz using SysTick interrupts. 
              Wrote a C function that converted the ADC sample into distance, with units of 0.001 cm. 
              The data stream was passed from an Interrupt Service Routine(ISR) into the main program using a mailbox, 
              and the main program outputted the data on a display connected to a  
              Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter(UART).
            </li>
            <li>
              Interfaced DC motors with Pulse Width Modulation PWM and also Stepper motors(for a robot car)
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed and built a prototype simple pacemaker. The system will read from a switch, 
              make decisions, and outputs to an LED. Wrote subroutines that wait for the switch to be pressed, 
              wait for the switch to be released, and create an output pulse of fixed duration
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a switch interface that implements positive logic, 
              and an LED interface that implements positive logic.  
              Attached this switch and LED to a protoboard, and interface them a TM4C123 microcontroller
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

#Accomplishment 2
- summary:
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>Using the MFC library, implemented dialog boxes, 
        windows resources(icons, menus, cursors, bitmaps, string tables etc), 
        windows controls (progress bars, buttons, boxes, scrool bars, tree control etc), 
        network commuinications using windows sockets, .lib/.dll libraries, serialization, property sheets,
        multithreading, manipulation of file systems, database access etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

#Accomplishment 3
- summary:
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>Using Win32 API, implemented dialog boxes, windows resources, windows controls, 
        application that calculates the amount of overtime worked by an employee of a company in a payroll simulation,
        application that simulates sales of items in a department store or any other store(applies the tax rate 
        and present the total price to the customer) etc
       </li>
    </ul> 

#Accomplishment 4
- summary:
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>Built fullstack javascript applications using MongoDB, Express, Angular, Nodejs. 
        Some of them are featured in the projects section below
      </li>
    </ul>
